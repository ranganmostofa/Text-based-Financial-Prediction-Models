# Text-based-Financial-Prediction-Models

Implemented financial prediction models using machine learning and natural language processing algorithms. Our final proposed model achieves a simple accuracy of 64.35 %, which outperforms the accuracies of most other models that have been suggested as a solution to this problem in the past.
